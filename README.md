# Facial-Expression-Recognition-Model
A system that can detect human faces in an image or video and classify their facial expressions into predefined emotional categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, and neutral.


## Workflow:
### 1. Dataset Preparation:
Source Dataset:
Collect a dataset of facial images labeled with emotion categories (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, etc.).
Roboflow Integration:
Use Roboflow to upload, label, and preprocess the dataset.
Apply augmentations like rotation, flipping, cropping, and brightness adjustment to enhance diversity and improve the modelâ€™s generalization.

### 2. Model Training:
Base Model:
Use YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and modify it for facial expression recognition tasks.
Fine-Tuning:
Train the YOLOv8 model with the processed dataset from Roboflow.
Hyperparameter Optimization:
Tune parameters like learning rate, batch size, and epochs to achieve the best results.
Classes:
Train the model to detect specific emotion categories (e.g., Happy, Sad, Neutral, etc.).

### 4. Real-Time Inference:
Feed live video or images into the trained YOLOv8 model.
Detect and classify facial expressions with bounding boxes and emotion labels.
Use confidence thresholds to filter out less accurate predictions.


## Technologies Used:
### YOLOv8:
State-of-the-art object detection and classification model optimized for speed and accuracy.
Tasks: Face detection and expression classification.

### Roboflow:
End-to-end dataset management tool for labeling, augmentation, and dataset versioning.
Simplifies data preparation and ensures consistent input for training.

### Frameworks:
Python: For model training and integration.
PyTorch: Backend framework for YOLOv8 training.
